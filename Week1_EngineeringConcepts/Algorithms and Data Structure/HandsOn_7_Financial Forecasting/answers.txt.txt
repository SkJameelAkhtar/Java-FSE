Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It's a powerful way to handle problems that can be broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.
Recursion provides a very elegant and often more intuitive solution for problems that are inherently recursive, such as:
- Navigating tree-like data structures (e.g., file systems, organization charts).
- Mathematical problems like factorials or the Fibonacci sequence.
- Problems involving "divide and conquer" (like Merge Sort)

Let p be the number of periods.
The calculateFutureValue function calls itself p times. In each call, it performs a constant number of operations (one multiplication, one addition, one subtraction). Therefore, the total number of operations is directly proportional to p.
Time Complexity: O(p)
This is a linear time complexity, which is generally efficient.


For this specific problem, the recursive solution is already quite efficient, however, for this specific case:
1. Memoization (Dynamic Programming)
Memoization is an optimization technique used to speed up recursive algorithms by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
2. Converting to an Iterative Solution instead of Recursive.
