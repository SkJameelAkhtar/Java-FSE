In a system managing a large inventory (thousands or millions of items), performance is critical. Data structures and algorithms (DSA) are the foundation of this performance. The key points are:
- Speed
- Memory Efficiency
- Scalability
- Organization


Several data structures could be used, each with its own trade-offs:
Array, HashMap

Hashmap would be a good choice since lookup is very fast as compared to arrays since key can be easily determined.
HashMap (Our Choice):
Add (put): Adding an element is an average O(1) operation. The hash function computes the bucket location in constant time. In the rare worst-case scenario (many hash collisions), it can degrade to O(n).
Update (get then modify): Finding the product by its ID (productId) is an average O(1) operation (get). Modifying the object's attributes is also constant time.
Delete (remove): Finding the product by ID and removing it is an average O(1) operation.
